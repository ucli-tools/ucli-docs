Create Project Directory: Make a directory for your tool: <code>mkdir mytool &amp;&amp; cd mytool</code>   2.  Develop Bash Script: Create your main tool script, e.g., <code>mytool.sh</code>.       Ensure it includes the standard <code>install()</code>, <code>uninstall()</code>, <code>help()</code>, and <code>main()</code> functions.   3.  Add Standard Makefile: Create a file named <code>Makefile</code> in your <code>mytool/</code> directory.       Copy the exact content of the 'Standard Makefile Pattern' (shown above) into this file.   4.  Include License: Create a <code>LICENSE</code> file in <code>mytool/</code> with the Apache 2.0 ThreeFold license text.   5.  Write Documentation: Create a <code>README.md</code> file in <code>mytool/</code> explaining how to use your tool.</p> <p>Part 2: GitHub Integration and UCLI Build   6.  Create GitHub Repository:       *   Create a new public GitHub repository. The repository name must match your tool's script name (e.g., <code>mytool</code> for <code>mytool.sh</code>).       *   This repository can be under your personal GitHub account or an organization.       *   Push your <code>mytool.sh</code>, <code>Makefile</code>, <code>LICENSE</code>, and <code>README.md</code> files to this repository.   7.  Configure UCLI Access:       *   If your repository is not under the default <code>ucli-tools</code> organization, you'll need to tell UCLI about your GitHub username or organization.       *   Use the command: <code>ucli login &lt;your_github_username_or_org&gt;</code>   8.
